## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

Selecting an HTML element with the same tag for my CSS was a burden for me before, as I had to create an explicit classname to select that tag. However, this project gave me an idea to solve that problem using the child property of CSS

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.page__container-profile p:nth-child(3) {

}
```

### Continued development

The structural design of my HTML looks good, but in reality, it took me a lot of time to finalize it. So, I need to focus more on this.


### Useful resources
